# 2D CITY BUILDER GAME

In this city-building simulation game, the player takes on the role of mayor, tasked with transforming a defined square-grid area into a thriving urban environment. The map consists of fields where players can designate zones (residential, industrial, service), construct infrastructure (roads, power lines), and build service buildings (police, stadiums, fire stations, etc.). Citizens automatically build homes or workplaces within designated zones, provided they are accessible via public roads and powered by electricity.

The game operates in real time, with a day/month/year time system, adjustable to three speeds and pausable. The core gameplay revolves around maintaining citizen satisfaction, economic stability, and service efficiency. Residential and job capacities are limited per tile. Citizens choose jobs in nearby accessible workplaces, and their satisfaction is influenced by commute distance, public safety, pollution, and taxes.

Players must manage a city budget fueled by tax income from residents and businesses, and offset by the costs of infrastructure and services. Players can adjust tax rates and take out loans if necessary, though prolonged debt harms satisfaction. The game includes zones' visual saturation levels, and detailed overlays showing satisfaction and zone usage.

Advanced features include:

Electricity management, requiring placement of power plants and transmission lines to ensure functioning zones and services.

Forest mechanics that improve livability and reduce industrial pollution effects.

Fire risk system, with fire stations needed to prevent and react to fires that can spread and destroy zones.

Dynamic disasters (like meteors or chemical leaks) which damage zones and require player response.

Demolition mechanics with warnings and penalties if zones with active buildings are removed.

Game persistence, with support for saving and loading game sessions.

Overall, the game emphasizes thoughtful city layout, strategic growth, and balancing the needs of citizens with the city's economy.

How to Use:
Start a new game and choose map size and difficulty (if available).
Use the interface to place zones, build roads, and add service buildings.
Monitor citizen satisfaction, budget, and city population using HUD elements.
Rotate/pause game time as needed to manage growth or emergencies.
Use the save/load menu to preserve or resume progress.
Respond to fires, disasters, or shortages (e.g., electricity) to avoid penalties.
Build a balanced, happy, and growing city to win; mismanagement can lead to citizen exodus or mayoral removal.
